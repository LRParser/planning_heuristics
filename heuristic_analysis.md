TODO: Experiment and document metrics for non-heuristic planning solution searches

Run uninformed planning searches for air_cargo_p1, air_cargo_p2, and air_cargo_p3; provide metrics on number of node expansions required, number of goal tests, time elapsed, and optimality of solution for each search algorithm. Include the result of at least three of these searches, including breadth-first and depth-first, in your write-up (breadth_first_search and depth_first_graph_search).



If depth-first takes longer than 10 minutes for Problem 3 on your system, stop the search and provide this information in your report.
Use the run_search script for your data collection: from the command line type python run_search.py -h to learn more.
